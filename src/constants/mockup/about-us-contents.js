    "After working with shippers, carriers and freight brokers across the world, we witnessed the struggle of supply chain players unable to complete the transition to digital transactions. The impact of failed attempts across the industry have left players in the supply chain with slow and costly options that just don’t make sense. Like using credit cards to pay large B2B transactions. Like not being able to move bank funds fast enough to release ocean cargo from an overseas port. Like accepting bank payments from customers but not being able to reconcile them automatically. We knew there was a better way.",

Designing an experience focused on the supply chain, BlueX Pay enables businesses to send and receive payments easily in-country or across borders, whether it is bank-to-bank or with digital wallets.
